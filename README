# Video to epub

Have you ever wanted to `read` a film? If so then this is the project for you!

## Usage

If you have a video with subtitles:

```bash
$ ./video-to-epub video.mp4
```

Will ouput an epub file with the same name!

If you have separate video and subtitles files:

```bash
$ ./video-to-epub video.mp4 subs.srt
```

Tada!

## Why?

Idk, why not?
